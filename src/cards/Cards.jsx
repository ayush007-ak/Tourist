            <Card imgsrc={img2} title="Bargi Dam" text="Bargi Dam is one of the first completed dams out of the chain of 30 major dams to be constructed on Bargi River (Tributary of Narmada River) in Madhya Pradesh, India Here Narmada fully Submerge Bargi River that It can't be seen as it exist or not. Two major irrigation projects, named Bargi Diversion Project and Rani Avantibai Lodhi Sagar Project, have been developed by Bargi Dam. The Narmada is the largest river in Madhya Pradesh, flowing towards the west and falling in the Arabian Sea. Its total length is 1312 km of which it covers 1072 km in Madhya Pradesh.

The Central Water and Power Commission conceptualized the proposal of this dam construction in 1968 envisaging irrigation in 2,980 square kilometres and hydropower generation capacity of 100 MW (2x45 MW + 2x5 MW). (Source: DPR, Govt of M.P. 1968). Later the Bargi diversion scheme was planned, increasing the total irrigation potential to 4,370 square kilometres. The dam construction work started in 1974 and was completed in 1990 when the dam was filled to its complete capacity. Although the proposed power generation was 105 MW, currently only 90 MW is being generated in this HydroPower Generation Plant. Two independent units of 45 MW each have been set up and they function mainly during the evening peak in demand.

The height of the dam is 69 m and length 5.4 km. A lake of about 75 km in length and 4.5 km width, spreading over 267.97 kmÂ² in Jabalpur, Mandla and Seoni districts, is formed when the water is impounded up to the dam FRL of 422.76 m."/>

                <Card imgsrc={img6} title="Rani Durgavati Fort" text="Situated atop a hill in Jabalpur town is a small but enchanting fort of the Rajgond rulers. It was more of a manned post on vigil for invaders now enveloped in shroud of history. The fort dates back to 11th century AD. The fort is well associated with Rani Durgavati the Gond Queen and her son Veer Narayan. Rani Durgavati eventually died fighting the mughals and is hailed as a martyr in Indian history. She also built numerous temples and tanks scattered around Jabalpur chiefly around her Garha principality.[2]

The Rajgond rulers reigned over Jabalpur, Mandla and surrounding regions. Madan Mahal is one such fort built by them. Though not exactly an architectural marvel, the little fort is characterized by intrigue of ancient monuments in India.[3]

The structure generates an aura of awe being compact and yet fully equipped for martial encounters. The stable, war rooms, small reservoir and main pleasure chamber of the rulers offer visitors much to see and admire.[4]

The monument is situated at a height of about five hundred meters on the hill of same name. The Balancing Rock is a huge stone balanced on the tip of another. It is a geological wonder on the way to the fort.

There are many myths floating about the fort of the Gonds. It is said to harbor gold bricks and Gond treasures hidden somewhere in it in accessible underground folds. A tunnel covering a long distance is said to be located somewhere around the precinct - a possible escape route and transportation artery of the Gonds.

Nearest Railway station is Madan Mahal railway station."/>
